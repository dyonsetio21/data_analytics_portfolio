  - The average speed to answer was 67.52 seconds, which may impact customer experience.
  - 72.92% of calls were resolved, leaving 27.08% unresolved, which could indicate inefficiencies in handling customer issues.

- **Agent Performance**
  - Agents handled an average of 456 calls over three months.
  - Jim had the highest number of calls handled (485) but a below-average satisfaction rating (3.40/5).
  - Martha had a high satisfaction rating (3.50/5) while handling 461 calls.
  - The average talk duration per call was 224.92 seconds (3.7 minutes).

- **Customer Satisfaction**
  - The overall customer satisfaction rating was 3.40/5, indicating room for improvement.
  - No agent achieved a rating above 3.50, suggesting possible service quality gaps.

- **Call Volume Trends**
  - Calls were relatively stable across January (1,455), February (1,298), and March (1,301).
  - The call volume did not show drastic fluctuations, implying a consistent demand for support.

## **Business Recommendations:**

  - Increase staffing during peak hours to improve response rates.

**2. Improve Call Resolution Rates**
  - Provide targeted training for agents to enhance issue resolution skills.
  - Introduce knowledge bases and AI-assisted recommendations to help agents resolve issues faster.

**3. Enhance Customer Satisfaction**
  - Monitor customer feedback and identify recurring complaints.
  - Implement personalized follow-ups for unresolved cases to boost satisfaction scores.

**4. Optimize Agent Performance**
  - Recognize and reward high-performing agents (e.g., Martha) while identifying training needs for others.
  - Encourage best practices sharing among agents to improve service quality.
