# Analyzing Reactions on Social Media: Extracting Insights from Datasets

## Description
This task involves a virtual job simulation for Accenture's North America Data Analytics and Visualization role on Forage.
This project aims to analyze user reactions on social media based on a dataset containing various reactions (like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry). 
Using Python and several data analysis libraries, an exploration is done to look for trends in reactions and draw insights from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project:
- **File name**: `Reactions.csv`
- **Source**: Virtual job data on Forage.com
- **Key features**: Reaction type, number of reactions, and reaction time are given

## Tools
- **Python**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Excel**

## Analysis performed
1. **Distribution of user reactions**  
   - Analyzed the number of each type of reaction in the dataset.  
2. **Reaction trends over time**  
   - See how reactions change over time  
3. **Relationships between reaction types**  
   - Identify patterns in the distribution of reactions  

## Visualization Results
