## Project Overview
This project is part of an advanced portfolio in the **Tableau Data Visualization Series**.  
The dashboard explores rider behavior patterns using the **Cyclistic Bike-Share dataset**, aiming to understand differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**.  
It provides insights into ride volume, duration trends, and usage behavior across time and stations.
